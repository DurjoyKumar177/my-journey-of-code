# 🧠 My Journey of Code

**Welcome to my personal programming archive — a living record of everything I’ve learned and practiced throughout my coding journey.**
This repository is a structured and ongoing collection of code snippets, foundational projects, and problem-solving exercises that have helped me grasp new languages, concepts, and technologies. From the early days of learning C and C++ to diving into modern full-stack development with Django and React, each folder represents a step forward in my growth as a developer. As I continue to explore and learn, this repository will be regularly updated to reflect my progress.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repo serves as:

- A **learning journal** of my growth as a developer.
- A place to **preserve my progress** over time.
- A **reference hub** for concepts I’ve learned and practiced.

Each folder contains code samples, exercises, and small projects based on my self-study, coursework, and problem-solving experience.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
 C/ → Basic C programs, control flow, functions, arrays, pointers


 
## ✍️ How I Commit

To reflect my learning better, I’m gradually adding code with meaningful commit messages like:

- `Add basic C programs: loops and conditions`
- `Solve DSA problems: Stack, Queue`
- `Build login form in React`
- `Practice SQL joins and subqueries`

This helps show my journey clearly — not just the destination.
